#myNBAgames

myNBAgames is an app built with a light Ruby on Rails backend and a heavy React/Redux frontend. A user can search a player by his first and last name which returns the player's profile information.

myNBAgames creates JSON files of all current NBA players in the 2016 season using NBC's NBA website and parses each game's JSON file seeding the database with all the players.
